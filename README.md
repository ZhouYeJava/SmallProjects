###Project_For_Fun

* Checkee Analysis: I was so boring during the waiting time for my visa; thus I wrote a short script to visulize the statistics of waiting time.
* Kalah: I helped my friend write a game in C++. Only Human vs Human; no AI. 
* Labyrinth: I helped my friend write a short C++ program for finding shortest path in a 3D labyrinth.
